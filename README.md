Kid Reads 2.0 is an interactive E-Reader desgined specifically for children! 

An easy, interactive site, Kid Reads was made with your children in mind. Your child's
homepage is simple, unique, and safe containing only the reading material you have selected.

What makes Kid Reads different from other E-Readers is that while it was designed for kids, it was specifically designed to help children learn to read, improve their reading skills AND help those with speech difficulties overcome their challenge with confidence.
